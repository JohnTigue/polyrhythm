## Polyrhythm

There are already sundry polyrhythm visualization and practice utilities on the web. 
These are just my take on the same – a sandbox within which to have some fun with web
front-end tech. This will involve JS & SVG single page apps (SPAs) – maybe even get
into using the microphone?

### Motivation
The following are some examples of what exists and how I would like to improve upon the ideas.

The book [Clave Matrix](http://www.unlockingclave.com/volume-1-the-clave-matrix.html) 
is actually the original motivator for this project.
The book's website has [a visualization of the standard bell pattern](http://www.unlockingclave.com/standard-pattern-animation.html)
which is simply a Quicktime video. That is just begging to be a SVG-based SPA.

The book has other visualizations and animations that would be fun to web-ify. 
Even the cover image is a 2:3 polyrhythm representation. Probably the best thing
to bang out would be an interactive way of exploring the 3 part polyrhythm that is
the clave. There could be options to do the son clave or the rumba clave, etc.

[Polyrhythm - 3 against 4 & 4 against 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgdLLitVxfI) 
is good enough. But notice how the video suggest to modify the playback speed to make
play along harder or easier.
